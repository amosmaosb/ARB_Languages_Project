            <li><h3>When it was created?</h3></li>
		<p>LISP was created in 1958 and first appeared in 1960.</p>
            <li><h3>Who created it (person or group)?</h3></li>
		<p>LISP was created by John McCarthy at MIT.</p>
            <li><h3>General history of the language (how has it evolved over time)</h3></li>
		<p>John McCarthy began creation of LISP in 1958 and "released" it in 1960 with his paper, it was created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs influenced by lambda calculus. It was first implemented by Steve Russell on an IBM 704 using ounched cards. During this it was noticed that the "eval" function from McCarthy's paper could be implemented in machine code. This led to a LISP interpreter. A bit later in a<em>1962</em> the first <strong>LISP</strong> compiler was made which greatly improved on the speed from the interpreter. </p>
            <li><h3>What type of problems the language is typically used for.</h3></li>
		<p>Originally LISP was just mathematical notation for computer programs based on lambda calculus but it was later found out that it could be implemented as machine code. The functional nature of the language made it very useful for Artificial Intelligence and that's mainly what it is used for now.</p>
            <li><h3>What is the current state of the language (who is still using it - what for?)</h3></li>
		<p>Currently, LISP is mostly used to code Artificial Intelligence</p>
