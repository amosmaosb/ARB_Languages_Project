            <li><h3>Who created it (person or group)?</h3></li>
		<p>Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto</p>
            <li><h3>General history of the language (how has it evolved over time)</h3></li>
		<p>Ruby was first concieved in 1993 when Matsumoto thought about the idea of an object-oriented scripting language. He knew of other object-oriented languages such as Perl and Python but did not think they were good enough, at least not as good of an object-oriented language he wanted. Ruby was first released publically in 1995 and was mainly popular in Japan until 1999 when the first english Ruby mailing list began. Ruby is currently on version 3.2 which was released in 2022.</p>
            <li><h3>What type of problems the language is typically used for.</h3></li>
		<p>Ruby is used for many things, it is a good general use language. Some notable uses are web development(Ruby on Rails), web servers, and data processing.</p>
            <li><h3>What is the current state of the language (who is still using it - what for?)</h3></li>
		<p>Ruby is not as popular as it once was but it is still relevant due to the web framework Ruby on Rails.</p>
