		<p>Rust was originally a personal project of Grayson Hoare while he was working at Mozilla Research. Mozilla would later sponsor his project as part of the development of an experimental browser engine. The first stable version wasn't released until 2015 though there had been previous versions. During the pandemic Mozilla layed off many people and this led to the creation of the Rust Foundation, who wanted to take ownership of all the trademarks and domain names. The formantion of the foundation was announced in 2021 by its five founding compaines: AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla.</p>
