		<p>PHP began development in 1993 when Ramsus wrote programs in C to maintain his personal homepage. He expanded off of that base to create the first version of PHP, called PHP/FI at the time, and release it in 1995. It had much the same basuc functionality that it does today such as the ability to embed HTML. It didn't get the name PHP until the release of PHP 3 in 1997 where it was renamed to PHP: Hypertext Processor which is a recursive acronym.</p>
