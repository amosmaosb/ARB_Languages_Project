            <li><h3>When it was created?</h3></li>
		<p>C# was created in 2000.</p>
            <li><h3>Who created it (person or group)?</h3></li>
		<p>C# was created by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft </p>
            <li><h3>General history of the language (how has it evolved over time)</h3></li>
		<p>C# was originally called "Cool" which stood for "C-like Objected Oriented Language." The name was eventually changed to C# before it was released in 2000. It was approved as an international standard by Ecma in 2002 and by ISO/IEC in 2003. The creator of Java, James Gosling, said that C# was just a copy of Java but Anders insisted that it was more like C++. Either way, in 2005 C# 2.0 was released and ended up going in a different direction than Java. C# ended up implementing generics as first-class generic objects whereas Java generics where more like a language syntax feature. In 2008 C# 3.0 was released with LINQ extentions which made it posible to code in a functional-style way. </p>
            <li><h3>What type of problems the language is typically used for.</h3></li>	
		<p>C# is meant to be versatile and solve many different kinds of problems. Its strengths are that it is versatile, uder-friendly, and available on many different devices and operating systems.</p>
            <li><h3>What is the current state of the language (who is still using it - what for?)</h3></li>
		<p>C# is now <strong>more</strong> used due to its simplicity which allows programmers to make applications in short times.C# is also popular among video game developers due to it working well with Unity.</p>
